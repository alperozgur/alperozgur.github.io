In vascular surgery, clinically relevant calculators help guide decision-making, risk stratification, and treatment planning. These tools are often used preoperatively and postoperatively to predict outcomes, assess risk, and determine appropriate interventions. Here's a categorized list of commonly used and validated calculators in vascular surgery:

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Aneurysmal Disease**
- **SVS AAA Risk Score**  
  Predicts 30-day morbidity and mortality after elective open abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair.

- **VQI rAAA Risk Calculator**  
  Estimates operative mortality risk in patients with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (rAAA).

- **UIAA (University of Iowa Aneurysm) Score**  
  Predicts 30-day mortality and complications for endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR).

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Carotid Artery Disease**
- **Carotid Artery Stenosis Risk Calculator (CREST-derived)**  
  Helps determine the risk of stroke and other complications following carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or carotid artery stenting (CAS).

- **Stroke Risk Score After CEA**  
  Uses patient-specific data to estimate risk of perioperative stroke.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD)**
- **WIfI Classification (Wound, Ischemia, and foot Infection)**  
  Stratifies the risk of amputation and guides limb salvage strategy.

- **GLASS (Global Limb Anatomic Staging System)**  
  Used with WIfI for chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI), guiding revascularization strategy.

- **VQI PAD Risk Model**  
  Predicts 30-day outcomes for interventions such as fem-pop bypass or endovascular therapy.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Venous Disease**
- **Caprini Score**  
  VTE (venous thromboembolism) risk stratification in surgical patientsâ€”important for prophylaxis decisions.

- **CEAP Classification**  
  Clinical, Etiologic, Anatomic, Pathophysiologic classification for chronic venous disorders.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **General Surgical Risk**
- **ACS NSQIP Surgical Risk Calculator**  
  Used broadly in vascular surgery to estimate 30-day morbidity and mortality after a range of operations.

- **Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI)**  
  Assesses cardiac risk in patients undergoing non-cardiac (including vascular) surgery.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Miscellaneous**
- **BODE Index**  
  For COPD patients undergoing vascular surgery (important for assessing respiratory risk).

- **Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) Calculator**  
  Simple but crucial tool for diagnosing PAD.
