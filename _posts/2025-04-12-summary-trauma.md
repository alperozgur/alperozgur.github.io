### When Are Endovascular Therapies Used in Vascular Trauma?

Endovascular techniques are now used in up to 25% of vascular trauma cases—mainly in hemodynamically stable patients. They're especially helpful in hard-to-reach areas like the pelvis, chest wall, and deep extremity vessels, where embolisation controls bleeding effectively.

Stent grafts are the preferred treatment for blunt traumatic aortic injuries, offering better outcomes than open surgery. In other vascular injuries, endovascular tools are used selectively, often as part of hybrid approaches, though evidence remains limited.

The rise of hybrid trauma operating rooms is improving access to rapid, combined treatment strategies. While long-term outcomes and follow-up remain challenges, endovascular techniques are becoming an essential part of modern trauma care.

### Resuscitation in Vascular Trauma: What’s the Best Approach?

> Damage control resuscitation principles and massive transfusion protocols used for patients with traumatic haemorrhage are recommended for patients with vascular trauma. 1A

> Early administration of tranexamic acid significantly reduces mortality in bleeding trauma patients, as demonstrated by the CRASH-2 trial. The recommended dose is 1g over 10 minutes, followed by 1g over 8 hours. Evidence does not show an increased risk of thrombotic events with its use, even in vascular repairs. I/A

> A pre-hospital tourniquet, applied as distally as possible, is recommended for patients with uncontrolled bleeding from extremity vascular trauma when local compression and or packing are not sufficient. I/C

> Heparinisation is not indicated as part of tourniquet management in patients with uncontrolled bleeding from extremity vascular trauma. IIIa/C
{: .prompt-danger }

> Resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) is not recommended as a routine approach for temporary haemorrhage control in trauma patients with exsanguinating torso haemorrhage.IIIb/B
{: .prompt-danger }

### Diagnostic imaging

> Haemodynamically unstable patients, deemed unsuitable for computed tomography angiography, are recommended to be immediately transferred to the operating room for surgical intervention.I/C
{: .prompt-tip }

> Computed tomography angiography, including arterial and venous phase, is recommended as the first line investigation to identify or rule out vascular injury in trauma patients without clinical signs of active bleeding.I/C
{: .prompt-tip }

> Avoiding or postponing computed tomography angiography because of possible renal impairment is not recommended in haemodynamically stable patients with potentially life or limb threatening vascular injuries.IIIb/C
{: .prompt-danger }

### Grading system for arterial trauma
![img-description](https://www.ejves.com/cms/10.1016/j.ejvs.2024.12.018/asset/b00eddb4-d1fc-42cb-bf4d-28e6974270ad/main.assets/gr1_lrg.jpg){: width="400"}{: .left }

Grade 1 injuries  
: Partial injuries to the internal vessel wall without compromise of the integrity of the vessel. E.g. intimal flaps or intramural haematomas following blunt or traction injuries. There is no compromise to distal flow or end organ perfusion. 

Grade 2 injuries  
: Complete disruption of the vessel wall without external bleeding, or any bleeding is contained. There may be adventitial disruption leading to external bulging of the vessel wall (e.g., in blunt arterial injury) or contained bleeding such as a pseudoaneurysm or arteriovenous fistula (e.g., after penetrating vascular injury).

Grade 3 injuries  
: Complete disruption of the vessel wall with active, uncontained haemorrhage. Bleeding may be external or free into the thoracic or abdominal cavity. Patients are in haemorrhagic shock and dependent on volume transfusions.

Grade X injuries  
: Occlusive injuries where there is no flow beyond the injury. Common examples of these are traction
injuries such as popliteal artery injury after knee dislocation or renal artery injury after sudden deceleration. Grade X occlusive injuries may also represent complete transections where arterial spasm has contained the bleeding and allowed thrombus to form, or they may have started as intimal tears that have subsequently thrombosed the vessel lumen.

### Treatment overview

Grade 1 injuries are usually managed non-operatively with clinical observation, often supplemented
with surveillance imaging. In some Grade 1 injuries,antithrombotic therapy is indicated  

Grade 2 injuries will usually require repair, and endovascular approaches are most commonly applicable.  

Grade 3 injuries require emergency repair, and this will usually be open surgery unless there is rapidly available access to endovascular methods and hybrid operating rooms.  

Grade X injuries is emergency intervention to restore flow provided the acutely ischaemic limb or end organ (e.g., kidney, brain) is salvageable.
