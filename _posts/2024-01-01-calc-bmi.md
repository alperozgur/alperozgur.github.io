Body Mass Index (BMI) is a numerical value derived from a person's weight and height. It serves as a quick and simple method to categorize individuals into different weight ranges, such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese. While not a direct measure of body fat, BMI is widely used as a general indicator of health and potential weight-related risks.

## How to Calculate BMI?

The formula for BMI is:

```
BMI = weight (kg) / [height (m)]Â²
```

## BMI Categories

| Category           | BMI Range       |
|--------------------|-----------------|
| Underweight        | < 18.5          |
| Normal weight      | 18.5 - 24.9     |
| Overweight         | 25 - 29.9       |
| Obesity            | 30 and above    |

## Why is BMI Important?

BMI provides a quick and easy way to screen for potential health risks related to weight. However, it does not directly measure body fat or account for factors like muscle mass, bone density, or overall body composition.

## Limitations of BMI

While BMI is a useful tool, it has limitations:

- It may overestimate body fat in athletes or individuals with high muscle mass.
- It may underestimate body fat in older adults or those with low muscle mass.
