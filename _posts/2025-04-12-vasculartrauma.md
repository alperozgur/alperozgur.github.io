### Navigating Vascular Emergencies: Insights from the 2025 ESVS Guidelines

As vascular surgeons, we often encounter trauma cases that require rapid, life-saving decisions under immense pressure. The newly released 2025 Clinical Practice Guidelines on the Management of Vascular Trauma by the European Society for Vascular Surgery (ESVS) serve as an essential compass in these critical moments.

These updated guidelines provide a comprehensive, evidence-based framework for managing vascular injuries—ranging from blunt and penetrating trauma to iatrogenic injuries. With trauma continuing to be a leading cause of death among younger populations in Europe and worldwide, timely and standardized care is vital.

The 2025 edition places strong emphasis on multidisciplinary coordination, urging closer collaboration between vascular surgeons, trauma surgeons, emergency physicians, and interventional radiologists. Importantly, the guidelines advocate for earlier use of imaging—especially CTA—and the judicious application of endovascular techniques where appropriate.

There is also a reinforced focus on damage control principles, with updated algorithms to guide decision-making based on hemodynamic stability, anatomical location, and available resources. Whether it’s temporary vascular shunting, resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA), or definitive repair, the guideline arms clinicians with strategic options tailored to individual patient scenarios.

Beyond acute management, the guidelines highlight long-term considerations like limb salvage, graft surveillance, and post-trauma rehabilitation.

For clinicians in the field, this is more than a document—it’s a lifeline to better outcomes. I highly recommend reviewing the full text and incorporating these protocols into your trauma workflows.
