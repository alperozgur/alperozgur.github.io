### New Insights from the ESVS 2024 Guidelines: Abdominal Aorto-Iliac Aneurysms

As vascular specialists, we are often faced with complex decisions in managing abdominal aorto-iliac artery aneurysms (AAIAAs). The newly released 2024 Clinical Practice Guidelines by the European Society for Vascular Surgery (ESVS), designated as an Editor’s Choice, provide a timely and comprehensive roadmap for evidence-based care in this challenging area.

This updated guideline is a critical resource for clinicians, synthesizing the latest literature and expert consensus into a structured approach to diagnosis, surveillance, and intervention. It expands on previous iterations by incorporating new data on endovascular and open surgical strategies, individualized patient risk assessment, and post-intervention surveillance.

Of particular note is the emphasis on a tailored approach—balancing aneurysm morphology, patient comorbidities, and life expectancy—to guide therapeutic decision-making. The guideline also offers practical recommendations on when to intervene, optimal imaging modalities, and perioperative management protocols to reduce complications.

A key advancement is the nuanced guidance on managing iliac aneurysms, which are often underrecognized yet carry significant risks. The document also highlights the increasing role of endovascular techniques, reflecting growing evidence supporting their efficacy and safety in selected patient populations.

For those of us in the field, this guideline is not only a scientific update but a call to elevate our practice with the best available evidence. I strongly encourage colleagues to review and integrate its recommendations to improve outcomes for patients with these potentially life-threatening vascular conditions.
